# Project Title

A brief description of the project.

## Technologies Used

* Symfony 5.4
* Vue 3
* Vite

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git`
2. Install dependencies:
    - Run `composer install` to install PHP dependencies
    - Run `npm install` to install JavaScript dependencies
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the Symfony development server: `symfony server:start`

Now you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000/`.

You can also run the development server by using the command `npm run dev` instead of `npm run build` in step 3. This will start the Vite development server and enable live-reloading of your changes.

Note: Before running the Symfony server, make sure that you have [installed Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) on your system.
