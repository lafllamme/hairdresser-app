## ⚠️ Disclaimer: Do Not Manually Compile TypeScript Files ⚠️

**Important:** It is crucial that you do not manually compile the TypeScript files in this project. The build process is handled by Vite and configured to work seamlessly with Vue and Symfony. Manually compiling the TypeScript files may lead to unexpected issues and break the application.

Please follow the provided installation and development instructions to build and run the project. If you encounter any difficulties or have questions, feel free to contact the project team for assistance.

**Remember:** Stick to the provided build scripts (`npm run build` or `npm run dev`) and let Vite handle the compilation process for a smooth development experience.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git`
2. Install dependencies:
   - Run `composer install` to install PHP dependencies
   - Run `npm install` to install JavaScript dependencies
3. Build the project: `npm run build`
4. Start the Symfony development server: `symfony server:start`

Now you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000/`.

You can also run the development server by using the command `npm run dev` instead of `npm run build` in step 3. This will start the Vite development server and enable live-reloading of your changes.

**Note: Before running the Symfony server, make sure that you have [installed Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download) on your system.**
